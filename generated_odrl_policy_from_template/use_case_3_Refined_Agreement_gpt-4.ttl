# 4. Rule 4: The policy has 'odrl:assigner' property value and it is of type Party.
# 5. Rule 5: The policy has 'odrl:assignee' property value and it is of type Party.
# 6. Rule 6: The policy has 'odrl:target' property value and it is of type Asset.
# 7. Rule 7: The policy uses 'odrl:use' action which is a standardized action value.
# 8. Rule 8, 9, 10: Not applicable as 'odrl:duty' and 'odrl:prohibition' rules are not used in this policy.
# 11. Rule 11: Not applicable as 'odrl:prohibition' and 'odrl:obligation' are not used in this policy.

# In this refined policy, 'odrl:profile' and 'dc:issued' properties are added as per rules 2 and 3. However, the value for 'dc:issued' property is "Current DateTime" as a placeholder, it needs to be replaced with the actual date time when the policy is issued.
